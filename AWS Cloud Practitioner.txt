Cloud Computing:
The practice of using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than using a local server / personal computer.

On Premise:
-You own the server
-You hire the IT people
-You rent out the real estate
-You take all the risk

Cloud Provider
-The own the servers
-They hire the IT people
-The rent out the real estate
-You configure the services and code. Rest is taken care by them.

Types of Hosting
1. Dedicated Hosting: The single physical server belonging to the individual/organiztion only.
-Expensive, 
2. VPS (Virtual Private Server): A single server that is virtualized so that many different applications can be hosted each having their own resources.
-Scalability, Customizability, isolation
3. Shared Hosting: A single physical server shared with multiple users so resources are shared
-Cheap, less isolation
4.Cloud Hosting: Simialr to VPS however multiple physical machines are involved.
-Reliable

Cloud Service Providers (CSPs):
- Offer multiple cloud services
- Services can be chained together to form cloud architecture
- Accessible via a single unified API
- Offer automation via Infrastructure as code (IAC)
- Rich monitoring of services
- Plans highlighting cost for services consumes e.g per second, per hour
- Have Infrastructure as a service offering.

Types of cloud computing:
1. SAAS - Software as a service - A product ran and maintained by the service provider. Don't worry about how the service is maintained. It just works and
remains available. Salesforce, GMAIL, Office365.
2. PAAS - Platform as a service - Focus and development and management of your apps. Don't worry about provisioning, configuring and or understanding the
hardware or OS. Heroku, Elastic Beanstalk
3.IAAS - The basic building block for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space. We don't worry about IT staff,
datacenters and hardware. Azure, AWS

Cloud Computing Deployment Models:
Public cloud - everything (workload or project) is build on CSP
Private Cloud - Everything build on company's datacenter (on premise)
Hybrid Cloud - Both Public and private cloud
Cross Cloud - Using multiple Cloud Providers

Burning Platform is the term used when a company abandons old technology for new technology with the uncertainity of success and can be motivated by fear that
the organization's survival relies on digital transformation.

Benefits of Cloud:
1. Pay on demand - You pay for only what you use.
2. Sharing the cost with other customers
3. Scale up or down based on need i.e. Lauch and destroy services whenever
4. Lauch resources within minutes
5. No expenditure on maintenance
6. Launch your app globally in multiple regions to reduce latency.
7. Reliable - Fault tolerant, data replication, data backup
8. The underlying software and hardware is patched, upgraded and replaced by the cloud provider with affecting end consumer
