Terraform is a tool for building, changing and versioning infrastructure
safely and efficiently.

Terraform falls under the Infrastructure As Code (IAC) tool category

Provisioning Cloud Resources:
1. GUI
2. CLI / API
3. IAC

Categories of IAC tools:
1. Ad hoc scripts
2. Configuration management tools - manage the configuration of 
infrastructure, application and services
3. Server templating tools - build the template to be deployed(eg. Packer)
4. Orchestration tools - managing application deployment
5. Provisioning tools

These tools can be declarative or imperative.

IAC Provisioning
1. Cloud specific: AWS Clod Formation, Microsoft Azure Resource manager,
Google Cloud Plaform Cloud Deployment Manager.
2. Cloud Agnostic: Terraform, Pulumi

Provisioning tools and configuration management tools compliment each
other. Provisioning tools like teraaform can be used for cretaing the
infrastructure and configuration management tools can be used configuring
application deployment. Provisioning tools tend to be declarative while
configuration management tools tend to be imperative.
Ansible is a configuration management tool.

Common Patterns
1. Provisioning + Configuration Management
2. Provisioning + Server Templating
3. Provisioning + Orchestration

Terraform Core: Terraform State + Terraform Config + Provider
